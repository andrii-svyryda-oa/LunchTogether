Backend:

Python 3.12
uv (manage project using pyproject.toml and uv tools)
ruff (linting and formatting)
ty (linter)

sentry for error tracking

FastAPI
Pydantic
SQLAlchemy
Alembic
PostgreSQL

Files should be stored in file storage.

Everything should be async.
All dependencies (like database, workflows, repositories) should be injected using dependency injection.
There should be base repository class that implements all the basic CRUD operations. Specific repositories should inherit from it and implement the specific operations.
All business logic should be in workflows. Repositories should be injected into workflows. Workflows should be injected into endpoints.
Workflows is a class that implements the business logic for a specific use case. Each Workflow should have pydantic input and output models.
If endpoint should query database without any business logic, it should use repository directly.
All endpoints should have pydantic models for request and response.

Auth should be implemented using JWT in cookies.

Frontend:

typescript
React
Redux Toolkit for state management and api calls (injectEndpoints)
shadcn/ui for components
tailwindcss for styling
react-router for routing

Frontend should use modular architecture (separation of components by modules, and can be nested if needed). Constants, hooks, apis, slices - each type of file should have separate folder where all related files are stored.

Deployment:

Everythin will be deployed on VPC machine, to which I have access via SSH.
There should be one time script that will install everything required on machine (python, node, run database etc.) 
There should be nginx to serve frontend and backend, and certbot to get SSL certificate.
Script should have parameters which needed to be set up on machine.
All services should be started as systemd services.
github actions should build and deploy backend and frontend on merge and deploy via ssh and restart services.
