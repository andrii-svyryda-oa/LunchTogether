# Epic 3: Admin Users Management

## Overview

Application Admins have the ability to manage all users on the platform. This includes viewing, creating, and editing user accounts.

## Business Requirements

### Viewing Users

- Admins can see a list of all registered users on the platform.
- Regular users cannot see the full list of users — they can only see members within their own groups.

### Creating Users

- Admins can create new user accounts directly.

### Editing Users

- Admins can edit any user's account details.

### Managing Groups (Admin Perspective)

- Admins can observe all groups across the platform, not just groups they belong to.
- Admins can edit any group regardless of membership.
- Admins can create new groups.
