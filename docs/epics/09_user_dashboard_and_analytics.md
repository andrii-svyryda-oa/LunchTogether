# Epic 9: User Dashboard & Analytics

## Overview

The user's personal home page provides a central place for viewing cross-group analytics and accessing account settings. It is accessible from the main navigation menu.

## Business Requirements

### User Home Page

- The first item in the main (left) navigation menu is a button that leads to the **user home page**.
- The user home page provides analytics and navigation to account settings.

### User-Level Analytics

- The user home page should display personal analytics aggregated across all the user's groups — giving them insight into their overall activity, spending patterns, and participation.

### Navigation to Settings

- From the user home page, the user can navigate to their **account settings**.
- Settings include at minimum the user preference for whether to auto-navigate to an active order when entering a group page (or always land on the group home page).
